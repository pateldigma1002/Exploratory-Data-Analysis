# Loan Default Risk Analysis

## 1. Introduction

This assignment provides an opportunity to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real-world business scenario, focusing on risk analytics in the banking and financial services sector. By utilizing EDA techniques, we aim to develop insights into consumer finance and understand how data can be leveraged to minimize the risk of financial losses while lending to customers.

## 2. Business Understanding

### Loan Approval Challenges
Loan-providing companies face challenges when approving loans, especially for individuals with insufficient or non-existent credit history. Some consumers exploit this situation by defaulting on loans. As an employee of a consumer finance company specializing in lending to urban customers, the goal is to use EDA to analyze patterns in the data. The objective is to ensure that applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

### Risks Associated with Loan Decisions
The company's decision-making involves assessing two types of risks:
1. **Loss of Business:** If an applicant is likely to repay the loan but is rejected, it results in a loss of business for the company.
2. **Financial Loss:** If an applicant is likely to default, approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

### Data Scenarios
The dataset includes information about loan applications, categorizing clients into two scenarios:
1. **Payment Difficulties:** Clients with late payments exceeding a defined threshold on at least one of the initial installments.
2. **Timely Payments:** All other cases where payments are made on time.

### Decision Types
Clients and companies make four types of decisions during the loan application process:
- **Approved:** The company approves the loan application.
- **Cancelled:** The client cancels the application during approval, either due to a change of mind or receiving unfavorable terms.
- **Refused:** The company rejects the loan application.
- **Unused Offer:** The client cancels the loan at various stages of the process.

## 3. Business Objectives

The primary objectives of this case study are to:
- Identify patterns indicating clients' difficulty in paying installments.
- Utilize these patterns for decision-making, such as loan denial, reduced loan amounts, or higher interest rates for risky applicants.
- Ensure that consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

The company aims to understand the driving factors (driver variables) behind loan default, using this knowledge for portfolio management and risk assessment.
